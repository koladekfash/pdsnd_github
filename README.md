### Project Title
Explore US Bikeshare Data

### Description
This project makes use of Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. It imports the data and answers interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. It takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.
In this project, you will use data provided by Motivate, a bike share system provider for many major cities in the United States, to uncover bike share usage patterns. You will compare the system usage between three large cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington, DC.
